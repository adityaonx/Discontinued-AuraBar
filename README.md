# AuraBar 🎨

AuraBar lets you set custom menu bar colors for each of your apps 🎨 instead of using one single color for the whole system. When you switch to a configured app, the menu bar adapts to your chosen color, instantly returning to its native transparent look ✨ when you return to the desktop. 

### 🌟 Key Highlights
* **Visual Focus:** Automatically dims the menu bar against vivid wallpapers when windows are maximized, preventing "eye-glaze" and keeping focus on the app.
* **Pixel-Perfect UI:** Eliminates the annoying **1px gap** between the menu bar and active maximized windows for a seamless, professional aesthetic.
* **Granular Control:** No more global backgrounds, set specific colors for the apps you use most and let the rest remain native.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
**Use at your own risk.** AuraBar is provided "as is" without any warranties of any kind. As this utility interacts with system-level UI elements and requires specific permissions to function, the developer is not responsible for any issues, system instability, or data loss that may arise from its use.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

Because this utility is distributed independently, follow these steps to bypass macOS Gatekeeper:

1. **Download & Move**: 
   - Download the latest `AuraBar.dmg` from the [Latest Releases](https://github.com/adityaonx/AuraBar/releases/latest) section.
   - Drag **AuraBar** to your `/Applications` folder.
     
> [!NOTE]
> **Why is this needed?** macOS requires developers to pay a recurring fee to "notarize" apps. To keep AuraBar 100% free and open-source, it is self-signed. You can verify the source code yourself to ensure it is safe and respects the Principle of Least Privilege.

2. **First Launch (Bypass Gatekeeper)**:
   - Double-click **AuraBar**. You will see a security warning with buttons: **Done** and **Move to Trash**.
   - **Click "Done"** (Do NOT click Move to Trash).
   - Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security**.
   - Scroll down to the "Security" section. You will see a message stating "AuraBar was blocked..." 
   - Click **Open Anyway** and enter your password/Touch ID to confirm.
     
3. **System Configuration**:
   - To ensure AuraBar works correctly, you **must disable** the native menu bar background setting. 
   - Go to `System Settings` > `Menu Bar` > and toggle **OFF** "Show menu bar background".

4. **Terminal Fix (Optional)**:
   - If the app shows a "damaged" error due to missing signatures, run:
     ```bash
     xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/AuraBar.app
     ```



## 🆕 New in v1.1
   -	**Mechanical Blending:** Replaced flat color overlays with CAGradientLayer interpolation. The menu bar now samples the window header to create a natural luminance transition.
   -  **Security Gate:** Implemented a "Zero Trust" permission check. The app will never attempt to sample screen pixels unless the Screen Recording permission is explicitly granted and Dynamic Mode is active.
   -  **App Management:** Added a dedicated interface to manage per-app custom tints and a global exclusion list.
   -  **Sandbox Removal::** To resolve privilege issues interfering with window detection and UI overlays, the App Sandbox has been removed. This allows for a more reliable "Exclusive Full-Screen" detection.

## ✨ Features
- **OS Support:** Optimized specifically for **macOS Tahoe**. (Older versions are untested and not officially supported).
- **Smart Updates:** Built-in versioning system that fetches the latest manifest from GitHub.
- **Config Management:** Support for adding or removing individual application color mappings (v1.0.2+).
- **Native Performance:** Compiled specifically for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4).

## ⚠️ Known Issue: The "White-on-White" Contrast
In the current version, using a very light color mapping (like pure white) may result in white text/icons appearing on a white background.
Why? Since macOS 15+, the system's contrast sensor samples the desktop wallpaper to determine icon color (black vs. white), often ignoring third-party overlays. We are currently deducing a surgical fix for this behavior for a future release. For now, we recommend using colors with at least 15-20% saturation for the best visibility.

## 🛡 Security & Architecture
AuraBar is designed with a "Privacy-First" approach:
- **Least Privilege:** The app operates without root access, utilizing native AppKit APIs for menu bar manipulation.
- **Data Privacy:** Accessibility access is used exclusively to read `bundleIdentifier` metadata. No window content or keystrokes are logged.
- **Transparency:** Open-source logic allows for full audit of how mappings are stored in `UserDefaults`.
